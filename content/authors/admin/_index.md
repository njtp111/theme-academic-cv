#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Wollongong (UOW), supervised by [Prof. Jun Shen](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/jun-shen) and [Prof. Jun Yan](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/jun-yan). Before joining UOW, I obtained dual master's degrees from Southeast University in China, supervised by [Prof. Jieyue He](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/_s191/2019/0105/c23024a257498/page.psp), and Monash University in Australia in 2024. In 2021, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Shandong Normal University.
